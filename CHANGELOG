BrowserTime changelog

version 0.3 (NOT YET RELEASED)
------------------------
* Added frontEndTime (responseEnd & loadEventStart) & backEndTime (navigationStart, responseStart) measurements to make it cleaner when comparing.
* Collect page data (browser version etc.) on first timing run. This reduces the number of times the browser is
  launched, making BrowserTime run faster.
* Added -t option to set timeout value when loading urls (default remains 60 seconds).

version 0.2 (2013-11-05)
------------------------
* Add --raw flag to control if data for individual runs is included in output.
  The default is to not include run data. NOTE - this is a change in the default
  output from 0.1.
* Add optional --compact flag to disable pretty printing of xml and json.
* Update format of xml/json (NOTE - incompatible changes from 0.1)
 - all metrics and statistics are now floating point numbers
 - numbers in json output are now represented as strings (surrounded by quotes). This is an
    unfortunate side-effect of avoiding printing numbers in scientific notation.
 - time property of marks and measurements have been renamed startTime
 - measurements and statistics are now sorted according to start time.
* Changed max wait time for the Selenium driver from 30 s to 60 s 
* Updated org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java from 2.35.0 to 2.37.1
* Fix for Firefox 25 that added toJson in window.performance.timings

version 0.1 (2013-10-07)
------------------------
* First release
