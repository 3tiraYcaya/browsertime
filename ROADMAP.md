# Roadmap

The roadmap is a tentative plan for the core development team. Things change constantly as pull requests come in and priorities change, but it will give you an idea of our current vision and plan. 
  
The roadmap for the rest of 2021 is to refactor Visual Metrics and make a more solid way of running Safari on iOS.
